#### Recommendations

* There are more drivers than rides in the Urban area, so allocate more drivers in the rural and suburban areas

* Bringing mileage into the source data, so we can do more analyses like average mileage per ride, average mileage per driver

* We should do further analysis comparing each city to see if some have more drivers than others or some have a shortage of drivers

* It also may be benificial to analyze riders by hour to see if there are peak hours so the drivers can be better assigned or allocated
